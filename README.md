# IoT-Based Weather Station

## Project Description

This project implements a portable weather station using an Arduino Mega 2560, an ESP32 DevKit, a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, a rain sensor (both analog and digital outputs), and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) for illuminance measurement.  The Arduino collects sensor data, displays it on a 16x2 I2C LCD, and transmits it serially to the ESP32.  The ESP32 then connects to a Firebase Realtime Database and uploads the sensor readings. A Flutter-based mobile application retrieves this data from Firebase and displays it in a user-friendly UI. The app features a splash screen, a main weather display screen.

The system provides real-time monitoring of:

*   Temperature (°C)
*   Humidity (%)
*   Illuminance (lux)
*   Rain Status (Digital: Rain/No Rain)
*   Rain Level (Analog value)


## Components Used

### Hardware

*   **Arduino Mega 2560:**  The main microcontroller for reading sensor data and controlling the LCD.
*   **ESP32 DevKit V1:**  Handles Wi-Fi connectivity and communication with the Firebase Realtime Database.
*   **DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor:** Measures temperature and humidity.
*   **Rain Sensor Module:**  Provides both digital (presence/absence of rain) and analog (intensity) readings.
*   **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor):**  Measures light intensity (illuminance).
*   **10kΩ Resistor:**  Used in the voltage divider circuit with the LDR.
*   **16x2 I2C LCD:**  Displays sensor readings locally on the Arduino side..
*   **Jumper Wires:**  For connecting the components.
*   **Breadboard:** For easy prototyping and connections.
*   **Power Supply:**  6V - 12V power supply

### Software
